# Graph Neural Network for HR Analytics

## What is a Graph Neural Network (GNN)?

A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a deep learning architecture designed to process data structured as graphs. Unlike traditional neural networks that work with fixed-size inputs, GNNs can handle variable-sized graphs where both **nodes** (entities) and **edges** (relationships) carry information.

## Our Implementation

### Datasets Used

#### Employees Dataset

- **Attributes**: Individual employee details
- **Generated features**:
  - `experience_years`
  - `hours_worked_weekly`
  - `performance_rating`

#### Collaborations Dataset

- **Relationships**: Connections between employees
- **Features**:
  - `collaboration_strength`
  - `communication_frequency`

---

### Model Training Data

#### Input Features:

- **From Employees Dataset**:
  - Experience years
  - Hours worked weekly
- **From Collaborations Dataset**:
  - Collaboration patterns
  - Communication frequencies

#### Target Variable:

- **Performance Rating**
  - Scale: 1-5 rating

---

### Performance Calculation

#### Actual Performance:

- Generated in the initial dataset
- **Scale**: 1-5 rating
- Based on normal distribution (mean: 3.5)

#### Predicted Performance:

- **Generated by the GNN model**
- Considers both individual and collaborative features
- **Performance gap**: Actual performance - Predicted performance

## How GNN Processes Information

### Individual Level

Processes each employee's personal attributes:

- Years of experience
- Weekly working hours

### Collaborative Level

The GNN considers:

- Direct collaborations between employees
- Strength of each collaboration
- Communication patterns
- Performance of connected employees

### Network Effect

Each employee's prediction is influenced by:

- Their immediate collaborators
- The overall team structure
- The performance of their network
- Strength of collaborative relationships

This multi-level processing enables the GNN to capture complex organizational dynamics, providing more accurate performance predictions than traditional methods.

## Visualization

- **Node Colors**: Indicate performance levels
- **Edge Thickness**: Represents collaboration strength
- **Node Size**: Reflects employee centrality in the network

# Performance Analysis and Recommendations

## Performance Loophole Detection

### Underperforming Experienced Employees

Our system identifies employees who:

- Have **more than 5 years of experience**.
- Show a **performance gap** below `-0.5`.
- Are performing **below their predicted potential**.

This helps identify experienced employees who might need additional support or role adjustments.

---

### Weak Collaboration Analysis

The system detects:

- **Collaborations** with strength below `0.3`.
- Cases where at least **one employee** has high performance (>3.5).
- **Communication frequency** between team members.

This reveals missed opportunities for strong performers to elevate team performance.

---

### Team Dynamics Metrics

We analyze:

- **Average actual performance** across teams.
- **Average predicted performance**.
- **Performance variance** within teams.

These metrics help identify teams that may benefit from structural improvements.

---

## Recommendation Engine

### Mentorship Matching

The system automatically identifies potential mentor-mentee pairs based on:

- **Senior employees** with more than 8 years of experience.
- **Underperforming juniors** with a performance gap < -0.3.
- **Non-existing collaborations** between them.

This creates opportunities for knowledge transfer and performance improvement.

---

## Key Features

### Performance Gap Analysis

- Identifies the difference between **actual** and **predicted performance**.
- Helps spot employees who might be in the **wrong roles**.

### Collaboration Strength Monitoring

- Tracks the effectiveness of **team collaborations**.
- Identifies areas where **team dynamics** could be improved.

### Team Performance Metrics

- Provides overall **team health indicators**.
- Supports **strategic team restructuring decisions**.
